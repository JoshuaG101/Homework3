Homework - Data Mining - Association Rule Mining Interactive Supermarket Simulation with Association Rule Mining Overview In this assignment, you will design and implement an interactive application/web that simulates a supermarket shopping experience and performs association rule mining to discover purchasing patterns. This project combines data preprocessing, algorithm implementation, and user interface design to create a practical data mining tool. You are encouraged to leverage Generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.) to assist with this assignment. Appropriate Uses of Gen-AI: Learning and Understanding: Ask AI to explain concepts, algorithms, or debugging techniques Code Generation: Use AI to generate boilerplate code, UI components, or helper functions Debugging Assistance: Get help identifying and fixing bugs in your code Documentation: Assist with writing clear README files and comments Optimization: Ask for suggestions on improving code efficiency or structure Design Ideas: Brainstorm UI/UX design approaches Project Requirements 1. Shopping System Application (25%) Design an interactive supermarket shopping interface that supports: Required Features: Manual Transaction Creation Display at least 10 distinct products as clickable buttons/items Allow users to select products to create shopping transactions Display created transactions in a list or table Allow users to create multiple transactions CSV Data Import Implement functionality to import transaction data from CSV files Parse and load the provided dataset (sample_transactions.csv) Display import status (number of transactions loaded) Handle file format errors gracefully Data Display Show current transactions (before and after preprocessing) Display basic statistics (transaction count, unique items, etc.) Provide clear visual feedback for all user actions User-friendly Environment: Clean, intuitive interface suitable for non-technical users Clear step-by-step workflow Appropriate error messages and user feedback 2. Data Preprocessing (25%) Implement data cleaning functionality to handle the following types of dirty data: Required Processing: 1. Empty Transaction Detection and Removal Identify transactions with no items Remove them from the dataset 2. Single-Item Transaction Handling Detect transactions containing only one item Remove or flag them (single items have no association value) 3. Duplicate Item Removal Within each transaction, detect duplicate product entries Remove duplicates (association rules use set-based representation) 4. Product Name Standardization Handle case inconsistencies ("Milk" vs "milk" vs "MILK") Remove extra whitespace ("Bread " vs "Bread") Standardize all items to a consistent format (e.g., lowercase) 5. Invalid Product ID Handling Detect items not in the valid product list Remove invalid items or entire transactions as appropriate Preprocessing Report: Generate a simple report showing: Number of issues detected (before cleaning) Number of transactions removed Number of items cleaned Final dataset statistics (after cleaning) Example: 3. Association Rule Mining (50%) Implement BOTH of the following algorithms: Required Algorithms: 1. Apriori Algorithm Use horizontal data format Generate candidate itemsets level by level Prune using minimum support threshold Extract association rules using minimum confidence threshold 2. Eclat Algorithm Use vertical data format (TID-sets) Implement depth-first search Efficient intersection operations for support counting Algorithm Parameters: Minimum Support: User-adjustable (suggested default: 0.2 or 20%) Minimum Confidence: User-adjustable (suggested default: 0.5 or 50%) Performance Comparison: Track and display for each algorithm: Execution time (milliseconds) Preprocessing Report: ------------------- Before Cleaning: - Total transactions: 85 - Empty transactions: 3 - Single-item transactions: 5 - Duplicate items found: 12 instances - Invalid items found: 2 instances After Cleaning: - Valid transactions: 77 - Total items: 234 - Unique products: 18 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Number of rules generated Memory usage (if feasible) Present comparison in a clear format (table or simple chart). 4. User-Friendly Output (Included in Mining 50%) Primary Interface: Interactive Query (Required) Design an intuitive recommendation system where: Users select a product from a dropdown/search box System displays associated products with that item Show association strength as percentages (not just support/confidence values) Include simple business recommendations Example Output: Important: The default view should be user-friendly. Technical details should be hidden unless requested. Technical Requirements Programming Language No specific required language, but the following options are recommended: Python (recommended: pandas, numpy for data handling) JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js or browser-based) Java Libraries and Frameworks You may use standard libraries for UI, file handling, and data structures You must implement the three mining algorithms yourself (no data mining libraries like mlxtend, scikitlearn for the core algorithms) Query: Milk Customers who bought Milk also bought: - Bread: 78% of the time ████████████████ (Strong) - Eggs: 62% of the time ████████████ (Moderate) - Butter: 45% of the time █████████ (Moderate) Recommendation: Consider placing Bread near Milk in store layout. Potential bundle: Milk + Bread + Eggs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 You may use libraries for UI components, CSV parsing, and visualization Testing Test your application thoroughly from a user's perspective Ensure all features work correctly with the provided dataset Handle edge cases and errors gracefully Deliverables Required Submissions: 1.
